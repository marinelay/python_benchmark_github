He intuitively passed in a `pathlib.Path` object to the `app.static()` helper, and was surprised when it didn't work as expected.\r\n\r\nThis also might be a good time to talk about how difficult it can be sometimes for new users to troubleshoot a problem in Sanic.\r\n\r\nThis is the error my colleague was seeing:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/code/sanic/app.py\", line 1002, in handle_request\r\n    response = await response\r\n  File \"/home/code/sanic/static.py\", line 44, in _static_request_handler\r\n    file_path = path.abspath(unquote(file_path))\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.8/urllib/parse.py\", line 634, in unquote\r\n    if '%' not in string:\r\nTypeError: argument of type 'PosixPath' is not iterable\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was emitted on the static file response handler, at runtime. It is caused by the use of `unquote()` on file_path. The `unquote()` fn is not pathlib aware, so when `file_path` is a `pathlib.Path` object, we get this error. My colleague does not have a lot of experience with Python, so it was not obvious to him that it was caused by his use of pathlib.Path when registering the Static endpoint.",
