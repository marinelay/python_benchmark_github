        "body": "Hi, thanks for sharing this library. It seems to work well and is very easy to use indeed.\r\n\r\nOne minor issue is that if you import it on a computer with no GPU without manually specifying `gpu=False`, it will crash with a non-obvious error:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/easyocr/easyocr.py\", line 166, in __init__\r\n    self.detector = get_detector(DETECTOR_PATH, self.device)\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/easyocr/detection.py\", line 61, in get_detector\r\n    net.load_state_dict(copyStateDict(torch.load(trained_model, map_location=device)))\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/serialization.py\", line 367, in load\r\n    return _load(f, map_location, pickle_module)\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/serialization.py\", line 538, in _load\r\n    result = unpickler.load()\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/serialization.py\", line 504, in persistent_load\r\n    data_type(size), location)\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/serialization.py\", line 390, in restore_location\r\n    result = map_location(storage, location)\r\nTypeError: 'bool' object is not callable\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up the device detection slightly so it falls back to CPU with a warning instead:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> reader = easyocr.Reader([\"en\"])\r\nCUDA not available - defaulting to CPU. Note: This module is much faster with a GPU.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it should work the same way as before. Feel free to merge if that change is OK with you. Also, feel free to ignore this PR if you prefer it working the way that it is. I just found this way to be a lot easier for a less-experienced user to get started if they didn't have a GPU configured correctly.",
