href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7558\">#7558</a>: Fix pylint <code>not-callable</code> lint on <code>pytest.mark.parametrize()</code> and the other builtin

<strong>PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.</strong></p>\n<p>Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as\npossible, all warnings of type <code>PytestDeprecationWarning</code> now generate errors\ninstead of warning messages.</p>\n<p><strong>The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 6.1</strong>, so please consult the\n<a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html\">Deprecations and Removals</a>\nsection in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.</p>\n<p>In the pytest <code>6.0.X</code> series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a\nstopgap measure by adding this to your <code>pytest.ini</code> file:</p>\n<pre lang=\"{.sourceCode\" data-meta=\".ini}\"><code>[pytest]\nfilterwarnings =\n    ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this will stop working when pytest <code>6.1</code> is released.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have concerns</strong> about the removal of a specific feature, please add a\ncomment to <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5584\">#5584</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7472\">#7472</a>: The <code>exec_()</code> and <code>is_true()</code> methods of <code>_pytest._code.Frame</code> have been

Closes [issue 828](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/828).\n> \n> Version 4.5.3 -- 2019-03-09\n> ===========================\n> \n> -   Only packaging metadata changes.\n> \n> Version 4.5.2 --- 2018-11-12\n> ============================\n> \n> -   Namespace packages are supported on Python 3.7, where they used to cause TypeErrors about path being None. Fixes [issue 700](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/700).\n> -   Python 3.8 (as of today!) passes all tests. Fixes [issue 707](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/707) and [issue 714](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/714).\n> -   Development moved from [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy) to [GitHub](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy).\n> \n> Version 4.5.1 --- 2018-02-10\n> ============================\n> \n> -   Now that 4.5 properly separated the `[run] omit` and `[report] omit` settings, an old bug has become apparent. If you specified a package name for `[run] source`, then omit patterns weren't matched inside that package. This bug ([issue 638](https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/638/run-omit-is-ignored-since-45)) is now fixed.\n> -   On Python 3.7, reporting about a decorated function with no body other than a docstring would crash coverage.py with an IndexError ([issue 640](https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/640/indexerror-reporting-on-an-empty-decorated)). This is now fixed.\n> -   Configurer plugins are now reported in the output of `--debug=sys`.\n> \n> Version 4.5 --- 2018-02-03\n> ==========================\n> \n> -   A new kind of plugin is supported: configurers are invoked at start-up to allow more complex configuration than the .coveragerc file can easily do. See api\\_plugin for details. This solves the complex configuration problem described in [issue 563](https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/563/platform-specific-configuration).\n> -   The `fail_under` option can now be a float. Note that you must specify the `[report] precision` configuration option for the fractional part to be used. Thanks to Lars Hupfeldt Nielsen for help with the implementation. Fixes [issue 631](https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/631/precise-coverage-percentage-value).\n> -   The `include` and `omit` options can be specified for both the `[run]` and `[report]` phases of execution. 4.4.2 introduced some incorrect interactions between those phases, where the options for one were confused for the other. This is now corrected, fixing [issue 621](https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/621/include-ignored-warning-when-using) and [issue 622](https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/622/report-omit-overwrites-run-omit). Thanks to Daniel Hahler for seeing more clearly than I could.\n> -   The `coverage combine` command used to always overwrite the data file, even when no data had been read from apparently combinable files. Now, an error is raised if we thought there were files to combine, but in fact none of them could be used. Fixes [issue 629](https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/629/multiple-use-of-combine-leads-to-empty).\n> -   The `coverage combine` command could get confused about path separators when combining data collected on Windows with data collected on Linux, as described in [issue 618](https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/618/problem-when-combining-windows-generated). This is now fixed: the result path always uses the path separator specified in the `[paths]` result.\n> -   On Windows, the HTML report could fail when source trees are deeply nested, due to attempting to create HTML filenames longer than the 250-character maximum. Now filenames will never get much larger than 200 characters, fixing [issue 627](https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/627/failure-generating-html-reports-when-the).

Contributed by Daniel Hahler in [\\#228](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/228).\n> \n> 2.6.0 (2018-09-03)\n> ==================\n> \n> -   Dropped support for Python &lt; 3.4, Pytest &lt; 3.5 and Coverage &lt; 4.4.\n> -   Fixed some documentation formatting. Contributed by Jean Jordaan and Julian.\n> -   Added an example with `addopts` in documentation. Contributed by Samuel Giffard in [\\#195](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/195).\n> -   Fixed `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` in certain xdist configurations. Contributed by Jeremy Bowman in [\\#213](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/213).\n> -   Added a `no_cover` marker and fixture.

When\r\n  used, `docker-compose` will exit on any container's exit with the code\r\n  corresponding to the specified service's exit code\r\n\r\n- Added a `--parallel` option to `docker-compose pull` that enables images\r\n  for multiple services to be pulled simultaneously\r\n\r\n- Added a `--build-arg` option to `docker-compose build`\r\n\r\n- Added a `--volume <volume_mapping>` (shorthand `-v`) option to\r\n  `docker-compose run` to declare runtime volumes to be mounted\r\n\r\n- Added a `--project-directory PATH` option to `docker-compose` that will\r\n  affect path resolution for the project\r\n\r\n- When using `--abort-on-container-exit` in `docker-compose up`, the exit\r\n  code for the container that caused the abort will be the exit code of\r\n  the `docker-compose up` command\r\n\r\n- Users can now configure which path separator character they want to use\r\n  to separate the `COMPOSE_FILE` environment value using the\r\n  `COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR` environment variable\r\n\r\n- Added support for port range to single port in port mappings\r\n  (e.g. `8000-8010:80`)\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n\r\n- `docker-compose run --rm` now removes anonymous volumes after execution,\r\n  matching the behavior of `docker run --rm`.\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug where override files containing port lists would cause a\r\n  TypeError to be raised\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug where scaling services up or down would sometimes re-use\r\n  obsolete containers\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug where the output of `docker-compose config` would be invalid\r\n  if the project declared anonymous volumes\r\n\r\n- Variable interpolation now properly occurs in the `secrets` section of\r\n  the Compose file\r\n\r\n- The `secrets` section now properly appears in the output of\r\n  `docker-compose config`\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug where changes to some networks properties would not be\r\n  detected against previously created networks\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug where `docker-compose` would crash when trying to write into\r\n  a closed pipe\r\n",
