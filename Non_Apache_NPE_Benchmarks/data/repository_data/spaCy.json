This breaks the example file and I've made a change so that `nlp.tagger` will contain the feature_templates from `Tagger` if data directory is not found, should be helpful for people who are just starting out.\n#### 2. Fixed train_tagger expected `spacy.gold.GoldParse, got list`\n\nI finally for to play around with `train_tagger.py` but was greeted with the following message:\n\n``` python\n  File \"train_tagger.py\", line 74, in <module>\n    plac.call(main)\n  File \"/home/kendricktan/.virtualenvs/laice/lib/python3.5/site-packages/plac_core.py\", line 328, in call\n    cmd, result = parser.consume(arglist)\n  File \"/home/kendricktan/.virtualenvs/laice/lib/python3.5/site-packages/plac_core.py\", line 207, in consume\n    return cmd, self.func(*(args + varargs + extraopts), **kwargs)\n  File \"train_tagger.py\", line 60, in main\n    tagger.update(doc, tags)\nTypeError: Argument 'gold' has incorrect type (expected spacy.gold.GoldParse, got list)\n```\n\nFixed it by adding a `GoldParse` to `tag`.
